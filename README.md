# MemeGeneratorWow

This is the Python app that takes an image directory and text to generate a meme.

## Requirements

This uses TKinter, I guess :p

Simply by command line, do:

```
python run.py "image\directory" <NUM_TEXTS> "text1" "text2" ...
```

eg.

python run.py "images\doge_template.png" 2 "very doge" "wow"
```
