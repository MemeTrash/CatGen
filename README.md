# MemeGeneratorWow

This is the Python app that takes an image directory and text to generate a meme.

## Requirements

This uses Pillow, I guess :p (install with pip)

## Usage

Simply by command line, do:

```
python run.py "image/src" "image/dest_folder" "text1" "text2" ...
```

eg.

```
python run.py "images/doge_template.png" "images/" "very doge" "wow"
```
